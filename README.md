I am a iOS developer, technical consultant, and open-source contributor from 2013. Past 8 years i was iOS (Swift) developer and offer my services as an iOS developer for hire to work with businesses of all sizes including start-ups, creative agencies, designers, individuals and other freelancers & developers.

And early 2019 I noticed that using Flutter/Dart greatly reduces development time, enhance app performance and can make beautiful UI/UX therefore I completely switched to Flutter/Dart and studying deeply flutter and Dart.
